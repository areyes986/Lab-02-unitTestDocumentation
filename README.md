### How to use App

#### First Look
![First Look](first-look.png)
This is the first look of the application. As you can see the user is presented with the 4 different options to either to view their balance, withdraw, deposit, or exit the ATM. 

#### Using the Application


![Enter options](enteroptions.png)
The "1" in the red circle is the user input choosing to view their balance. It will look the same for other options as well, just with the corresponding numbers.  

![Balance](balance.png)
As you can see here, the user can view their balance and they have the option to do another transaction if they would like. The user can either enter "yes", "no", "y", "n", as well as the inputs being uppercase.

![withdrawl](withdrawl.png)
![Withdrawl Output](withdrawloutput.png)
Here we have the user wanting to withdraw $200.25 with the output as the desired withdrawl amount and their new balance. 

![Deposit](deposit.png)
Same thing for deposit.
#### Application End
![Finish](finish.png)
User can then start another transaction and enter "4" to exit and console will greet goodbye and allow user to exit.
